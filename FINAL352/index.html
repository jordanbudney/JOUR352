<h3 align="center"> Adjusting to college life is hard.</h3>

<br>

<p> From learning time management skills to keeping up with health needs, students like to relieve daily stress at on-campus gyms. Unfortunately, some may experience gym anxiety.</p>

<br>

<p>As a female college student, I prioritize staying active in my college routine and enjoy working out at the free gyms on campus. I find it challenging to use the weight room not only because it is male-dominated, but because I am intimidated by the people around me.  </p>

<br>
<p>Gym anxiety, or <a href="https://blog.ultimateperformance.com/gymtimidation-breaking-down-the-barriers-to-female-fitness/" target="_blank">“gymtimidation”</a> is the fear of working out in front of others or exercising in a public space. It combines anxiety and intimidation and can be a significant barrier when exercising, depending on the individual. Some contributing factors to this issue are feeling body conscious, worrying about formation, and even unrealistic expectations portrayed on social media. </p>



<h3 align="center"> NEGATIVE GYM EXPERIENCES </h3>

<p>In addition to having to worry about gymtimidation, sexual harassment is not uncommon in these environments. <a href="https://www.exercisebike.net/sexual-harassment-gym/" target="_blank"> ExerciseBike </a> polled 1,000 Americans about their experiences with sexual harassment at the gym to see what people define as sexual harassment and what they do in response. </p>

<br>

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="0e1cd24c-802c-4a78-982e-927c47a59ec8" data-type="interactive" data-title="Infogram of Sexual Harassment in Gymgoers"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/0e1cd24c-802c-4a78-982e-927c47a59ec8" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Infogram of Sexual Harassment in Gymgoers</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

<p>As shown above, 18.5% of females have experienced sexual harassment in a gym setting compared to only 7.3% of men, resulting in an 11.2% difference, according to ExerciseBike’s poll. In addition to over twice as many women experiencing sexual harassment, 52% occurred near cardio equipment, including treadmills, stationary bikes, and elliptical machines. </p>

<br>

<p>With these events comes emotional stress, and experts suggest the three common responses are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/hidden-health-effects-sexual-harassment-ncna810416" target="_blank"> depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</a> As a result of these events, 79% of women said they considered transferring to an all-female gym to avoid these interactions, according to ExerciseBike’s poll. </p>

<br>

<p>Although these experiences are more commonly found and expressed by women, men can experience sexual harassment in the gym too. ExerciseBike’s poll found that men are less likely to speak out if faced with sexual harassment at the gym, and only 14% felt comfortable confronting the harasser. </p>

<p>It is disheartening to see these repeated occurrences surface at the gym. These setbacks need to be addressed and broken down because each member should feel respected and welcomed in an environment that promotes the same goals. UMD promotes <a href="https://recwell.umd.edu/safety-wellness/wellness" target="_blank"> eight values of wellness </a> by supporting its students as they thrive and live well. </p>

<br>

<h3 align="center"> UMD GROUP FITNESS </h3>

<br>

<p>The University of Maryland has two on-campus gyms, <a href="https://recwell.umd.edu/" target="_blank"> Eppeley Recreation Center </a> and <a href="https://recwell.umd.edu/ritchie-coliseum-0" target="_blank"> Ritchie Coliseum </a>, and is free for all students. This includes weight rooms, cardio machines, and group fitness classes. Although this is ideal for most students, overcoming gym anxiety can be a setback.</p>

<br>

<p>Melinda Thompson, a fifth-year student at UMD, has worked with UMD Recwell for the past three years as a yoga instructor. As a group fitness instructor, she strives to empower her students to feel comfortable and “zen” in her classroom. </p>

<br>

<div class="headerbar">
<h4>“I like to focus on making sure everyone feels like their best selves in my classes. I know how stressful a gym setting can be, so I try and make my classes feel like the exact opposite,” Thompson said. </h4>
</div>
<br>

<p>Thompson does not like to work out at on-campus gyms and often feels intimated or lost when attempting a solo workout involving weights. She finds that conducting weekly yoga classes has allowed her to feel safe in a non-judgemental zone surrounded by active participants. </p>

<br>

<p>Although UMD offers a wide variety of group fitness classes, such as yoga, cycling, and Zumba, many students are unaware these exist or how to enroll. If you are interested in signing up for a class, click the link <a href="https://activeterp.umd.edu/Program/GetProducts?classification=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000026002" target="_blank"> here </a>. </p>

<br>

<p> Two out of three college women do not feel comfortable in the weight room, according to Changing Health, Attitudes, and Actions to Recreate Girls (CHAARG). They also noticed a clear divide between the weight room and the cardio machines and want to rebuild confidence in women in the gym. </p>

<br>

<p> <a href="https://chaarg.com/" target="_blank"> CHAARG </a> is an empowering health and fitness community at 111 universities nationwide that show women's fitness can be fun and that working out is better with friends. With over 10,000 members across the country, CHAARG offers a weekly workout class that changes from week to week. Their mission is to combine fitness with friends to help women feel their best in a safe and respectful environment.  </p>

<br>

<p>Annie Gorman, a senior at UMD and current ambassador of UMD’s CHAARG chapter decided to join her junior year to meet a group of girls who also valued wellness and health. Gorman finds it hard to work out in a public space alone and often feels intimidated doing specific workouts involving weights. </p>

<div class="headerbar">
	<h4> “I think a lot of girls and women weren't taught how to use weights and certain equipment growing up. And then once they want to start there's this fear that people will look at them and judge them if they do something incorrectly or they're not lifting heavy enough or something like that,” Gorman said. </h4>
</div>

<br>

<p>Linsey Hildebrand, a junior and VP Membership of UMD’s CHAARG chapter said she enjoys participating in group fitness classes because of the instructor leading the class and everyone being there for the same reason. Hildebrand also has gym anxiety and said not only does she feel judged by men but by other women as well, and wants to raise awareness. </p>

<br>

<p>“We've all said pretty much the same thing that we're nervous about other people looking at us and stuff so if we all kind of just recognize that everybody's nervous and like nobody really knows what they're doing perfectly. Like if we just talk about that more. I think that could help a lot too,” Hildebrand said. </p>

<br>

<p> <a href="https://chaarg.com/university-of-maryland/" target="_blank"> UMD CHAARG </a> is a great way for women who experience gym anxiety to continue staying active in college and being supported by a hardworking community. It is essential to have these resources available for students who are struggling to go to the gym and should be promoted more to help break stigmas in the gym. </p>
