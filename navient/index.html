<p>Student loans are a process of borrowing money for post-secondary education either through the government or other organizations and institutions. These loans are vital to families who can not afford another year of education and offers relief to repay these loans overtime. Since 2017,<a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank"> Navient Corporation </a> represents one of the nation’s largest federal student loan services but has been facing numerous lawsuits regarding their deceptive student loan practices. </p>
<br>
<p>The initial lawsuit began in January 2017 when the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/" target="_blank"> Consumer Financial Protection Bureau </a> filed a lawsuit accusing Navient of not acting accordingly with customers. Shortly after, several other lawsuits  were filed involving state attorney generals and teachers. In June 2020, a final settlement was reached stating that borrowers who were affected by the <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/#The_Navient_lawsuit_details_and_conclusion" target="_blank"> “widespread unfairness” </a> are eligible for direct relief. </p>
<br> 

<p> When taking out student loans, it is crucial to not only consider the school’s beneficial factors, but the overall ranking of the state’s education system. Education among the state can be considered a deciding factor for some students who are pursuing a post-secondary education. In the beginning of 2017, Naivent complaints saw a spike across the nation in student loan complaints, most likely due to the lawsuit. Fornuately the following month, Navient received far less complaints and has not seen a spike like that since. Below is a comparison of the top 10 Best States for Education in the United States, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education" target="_blank"> U.S. News </a>. The only state to increase in complaints was Washington and the only state that does not qualify for a restitution payment is Utah. Due to the overall decrease, I do not believe that Navient's lawsuit should be ongoing due to their responsiveness to resolve the issue and how Navient is servicing the correct loans to each family. </a></p>

<p>In the graph above, the majority of these states complaints dropped the following month after the initial lawsuit. Although Navient has received backlash for treating customers unfairly, it is clear that they did everything in their effort to resolve these ongoing issues. For a whole company to continue to give bad advice while trying to support families financial statuses seems wrong and unjust. Despite the issues and lawsuits, I believe that the spike in January 2017 was due to the publication of the lawsuit and families who thought they were in a good financial spot wanted to apply for more relief. If they were unhappy with their numbers in the first place, they should have complained then and not after the news. </p>

				<h2> A Closer Look at New Jersey</h2>
			


<br>

<p>As of 2023, New Jersey is the number one state for overall education, according to <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/best-states-for-education" target="_blank"> World Population Review.</a> As a Jersey native, it is common to hear people rave about the education but less about the costs. As of June 2020 when the final settlement was reached, here are the student loan complaints each month for the following two years.</p>

	<p> Although New Jersey was fairly consistent over those two years, there was a spike in October 2020 for student loans. In total, there were only 91 issues out of the total 2,759 in the nation over the course of June 2020 to June 2022. Additionally, New Jersey is one of the qualifying states as of January 2017, so it could have been easier for some families to get the support they needed. </p>
