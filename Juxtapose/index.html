				<p style="font-size: 16px; wiidth: 100%" align="left"> Apart from his jumpsuits, handsome looks, and iconic moves, Elvis Presley was a legendary musician. Born in Mississippi, Elvis was surrounded by music from all different cultures and backgrounds. At the beginning of his career, Elvis fused together these styles to create his once "jarring" moves that were then showcased to America in the 1950s. Despite the backlash and protests from some adults, teenagers immediatley fell in love with this new wave of rebellion.<br> Shortly after, Elvis' career took off. He produced hit records, was signed by a record label, and began performing sold-out shows to his dedicated fans for many years.  Additionally, he decided to experiment in television and movies where he had other serious aspirations. Although the movies themselves were not the greatest, Elvis' passion and dedication can be felt through any screen and remains timeless. Elvis Presley changed music and his impact on the industry will forever be remembered and honored.
